---

## Phase 0 — Platform Foundation (Arch §1, §3, §4, §7)
- [x] Create monorepo skeleton aligned to planned structure (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/fhir`, `packages/ui`, `infra`).
- [x] Set up NestJS 11 backend baseline with strict TypeScript, linting, formatting, and OpenAPI generation.
- [x] Set up React 19 + Vite frontend baseline with routing, query client, and shared UI primitives.
- [x] Provision local dev stack with Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, Keycloak, MinIO for object storage, API, web).
- [x] Add environment configuration strategy (`.env.example`, validation, per-service config).
- [x] Implement baseline auth handshake (OIDC login, token verification, current-user endpoint).

- [x] Add structured logging baseline and request correlation IDs.

---

## Phase 1 — FHIR-Native Data Model & Persistence (Arch §2, §3)

- [x] Implement migration set for all core tables with referential integrity. _(Baseline migration `20260306000000_init` created via `prisma migrate diff --from-empty`. Existing databases: run `prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260306000000_init`.)_
- [x] Add indexes identified in architecture (status, foreign-key traversal, date and lookup paths).
- [x] Seed initial roles, default enums, and one sample organization.

- **Known gaps (API layer):**
  - [~] `UpdateRecommendationDto` previously omitted `remark`, `rationale`, `practicalInfo` JSON fields — **fixed** (added to DTO + service). _(Was: UI sent them, API silently dropped them.)_
  - [~] `useUpdateRecommendation` frontend hook previously used `PATCH` while the controller declares `@Put` — **fixed** (changed to `PUT`). _(Was: recommendation saves failed in production.)_
  - [~] Guideline settings (`etdMode`, `showSectionNumbers`, `showCertaintyInLabel`, `showGradeDescription`, `trackChangesDefault`, `enableSubscriptions`, `enablePublicComments`, `showSectionTextPreview`, `pdfColumnLayout`, `picoDisplayMode`, `coverPageUrl`, `isPublic`) were absent from `CreateGuidelineDto`/`UpdateGuidelineDto` and not written by the service — **fixed** (added to DTO + service).
  - [~] `RecommendationsService.findByGuideline` was not including `sectionPlacements`, so `sectionId` was never returned — **fixed** (includes first placement and maps to top-level `sectionId`). _(Was: frontend `r.sectionId === section.id` filter always returned empty; no recommendations showed per section.)_
  - [~] `GuidelinesPage` "New Guideline" button was not wired — **fixed** (inline form with title + short name; calls POST /guidelines via `useCreateGuideline`).
  - [~] `fhirMeta` columns defined in Prisma schema — **fixed** (added `fhirMeta` to Create/Update DTOs and services for Guidelines, References, Picos, and Recommendations; cast to `Prisma.InputJsonValue` for type safety. Note: `fhirExtensions` column added to Guideline DTO.)
  - [~] `EtdFactor` model has no `@@unique([recommendationId, factorType])` constraint — **fixed** (added `@@unique([recommendationId, factorType])` to schema; `createMany` now uses `skipDuplicates: true`).
  - [~] `GET /sections` returns only one level of nested `children` (grandchildren excluded) — **fixed** (rewrote `findByGuideline` to fetch all sections and build full tree in memory).
  - [~] `SectionsService.findByGuideline` returns top-level sections only — **fixed** (tree is now built recursively with all descendants nested under their parents).
  - [~] Soft-deleted content is permanently inaccessible — **fixed** (added `POST /guidelines/:id/restore` and `POST /sections/:id/restore` endpoints).
  - [~] `ReferencesPage` (top-level `/references` app path) — **fixed** (built full page with cross-guideline reference listing, server-side search, grouped by guideline, "places used" badges showing linked sections/outcomes; API endpoint updated to support optional guidelineId and search filters).
  - [~] `DashboardPage` stats (Guidelines / Sections / Recommendations counts) are hardcoded as `'--'` — **fixed** (added `GET /guidelines/stats` endpoint; `DashboardPage` now fetches real counts via `useDashboardStats` hook).
  - [~] `AppShell` user section shows hardcoded "User" text — **fixed** (wired to `useAuth` store; displays user name/email and logout button).

---

## Phase 3 — Authoring UX & Rich Text (Arch §5.2, §5.3, §5.4, §9.2)
- [x] Build application shell (left nav, top bar, context breadcrumbs, guideline selector).

- [x] Integrate TipTap editor for section/recommendation narrative fields.
- [x] Implement section drag-and-drop reorder with stable persisted ordering.
- [x] Implement section auto-numbering and `exclude_from_numbering` behavior.

- [x] Add PICO builder UI and code-entry tabs.
- [x] Add outcome management UI with grouped ordering and state badges.
- [x] Add recommendation cards with rationale/practical information blocks.
- **Known gaps (Authoring UX):**
  - [x] Section creation UI — inline "Add Section" form added to `SectionTree` sidebar (+ button opens title input; submits via `useCreateSection`).
  - [x] Section deletion UI — `Trash2` delete button with two-step confirm added to each `SectionTreeItem`; wired via `useDeleteSection`.
  - [x] Recommendation creation UI — "Add" button + inline form added to `SectionDetailPanel`; wired via `useCreateRecommendation` (creates rec and links to section).
  - [x] Recommendation deletion UI — `Trash2` delete button with two-step confirm added to `RecommendationEditorCard`; wired via `useDeleteRecommendation`.
  - [~] PICO narrative summary field — **fixed** (added `narrativeSummary` textarea to PicoCard in PicoBuilderPanel; auto-saves on blur via `useUpdatePico`). _(Schema field is `narrativeSummary Json?`; DTO already had the field; only UI was missing.)_
  - [x] Practical issues (16 categories from grounded theory) for PICO — **fixed** (API: CRUD endpoints on `/picos/:picoId/practical-issues` with all 16 categories. UI: "Practical Issues" tab added to PicoCard in PicoBuilderPanel with category badge, inline create form with category dropdown, delete with confirm.)
  - [~] Reference "places used" tracking — **fixed** (top-level ReferencesPage now shows section and outcome link badges per reference; API `findAll` includes `sectionPlacements` and `outcomeLinks` with titles).
  - [x] Reference auto-numbering on read — **fixed** (added `computeReferenceNumbers()` to ReferencesService with depth-first section tree traversal; `GET /references/numbered?guidelineId=` endpoint returns numbering map; `findAll` attaches `referenceNumber` to each reference when guidelineId is provided).
  - [x] Track changes in TipTap — **fixed** (Created custom TipTap Mark extension with insertion/deletion marks storing authorId, authorName, timestamp, changeId. TrackChangesToolbar with toggle, accept/reject per-change and bulk operations. useTrackChanges hook. RichTextEditor updated with trackChanges and canManageChanges props.)

PresenceController with SSE stream endpoint. Frontend usePresence hook with EventSource + heartbeat. PresenceIndicator component with colored user avatars.)
  - [~] Guideline settings UI — **fixed** (added `GuidelineSettingsPanel` component with all settings fields; accessible via "Settings" tab in guideline workspace; uses `useUpdateGuideline` hook).
  - [~] `AppShell` top-level references tab — **fixed** (ReferencesPage now fully functional with cross-guideline listing, search, and places-used tracking).

---

## Phase 4 — Evidence Engine (GRADE + EtD) (Arch §3.1, §5.3, §8, §9)
- [x] Implement outcome evidence fields (effect measures, CI bounds, participant counts).
- [x] Implement GRADE certainty model and downgrade/upgrade factor persistence.
- [x] Build GRADE assessment UI (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, upgrades).
- [x] Implement plain-language summary field for each outcome.
- [x] Implement EtD models for 4-factor, 7-factor, and 12-factor modes.

- [x] Implement shadow outcome workflow for evidence updates. — **fixed** (API: create/promote/list shadows. UI: `ShadowOutcomePanel` with create shadow button, side-by-side evidence comparison, promote/discard actions with confirmation. Wired into `PicoBuilderPanel` via GitBranch toggle on each outcome row.)

- [x] Auto-create next draft after publish and mark prior versions as out-of-date. — **fixed** (publish resets guideline to DRAFT; MAJOR publish marks prior public versions as superseded via `isPublic: false`.)
- [x] Separate publishing from public visibility toggle with guardrails. — **fixed** (Added `PUT /guidelines/:id/public` endpoint with version-exists guardrail: cannot make public before publishing at least one version. Toggle available in GuidelineSettingsPanel.)
- [x] Implement permalink strategy (`shortName`, latest public, explicit version URL). — **fixed** (added `GET /guidelines/by-slug/:shortName` for slug resolution, `GET /guidelines/by-slug/:shortName/latest` for latest public version snapshot.)
- [~] Generate and store immutable version snapshot bundles. — **fixed** (enhanced `VersionsService.publish()` to capture comprehensive snapshots including full guideline metadata, organization, sections tree, recommendations with EtD factors, PICOs with outcomes/codes/practical issues, references with all links). _(Snapshot is stored as structured JSON, not FHIR Bundle — FHIR transformation deferred to Phase 7.)_
- [x] Add version history UI with compare and navigation affordances. — **fixed** (added `GET /versions/compare?v1=:id1&v2=:id2` endpoint returning both snapshots for frontend diffing. **UI**: `VersionHistoryPanel` with type badges, dates, publisher names, Latest/Superseded badges, JSON export, read-only snapshot banner. `VersionCompareDialog` with version selector dropdowns and diff table showing added/removed/changed paths.)

## Consolidated Bug / Gap Registry

The following items are confirmed bugs or incomplete wiring in the current codebase. They should be treated as sprint-ready tasks.

### P0 — Data-loss bugs (fixed in this audit)
| # | Area | Issue | Resolution |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| B-01 | API / Recommendations | `remark`, `rationale`, `practicalInfo` JSON fields missing from `CreateRecommendationDto`/`UpdateRecommendationDto` and not written by `RecommendationsService.update()` — silently dropped on save | Added to DTO; service now writes all three fields |
| B-02 | Frontend / Recommendations | `useUpdateRecommendation` sent HTTP `PATCH` but `RecommendationsController` declares `@Put(':id')` — all recommendation field saves failed silently | Changed hook to use `PUT` |
| B-03 | API / Guidelines | `etdMode` and 11 other guideline settings absent from `CreateGuidelineDto`/`UpdateGuidelineDto` and not written by `GuidelinesService.update()` | Added all settings fields to DTO; service now writes them |
| B-04 | API / Recommendations | `findByGuideline` did not include `sectionPlacements`, so `sectionId` was never populated in the response — frontend per-section filtering was always empty | Fixed: includes first `sectionPlacement` and maps to top-level `sectionId` field |

| ~~U-16~~ | ~~Packages / Widget~~ | **Fixed** — packages/widget Preact micro-bundle created |
| ~~U-17~~ | ~~Packages / Shared~~ | **Fixed** — packages/fhir expanded with 9 FHIR R5 type definition files; packages/ui expanded with 7 shared UI components (Button, Input, Badge, Card, Dialog, Select, Table) |

### P2 — Schema / data integrity gaps
| # | Area | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| ~~S-01~~ | ~~Database~~ | **Fixed** — Baseline migration `20260306000000_init` created with full schema SQL; `migration_lock.toml` added |
| ~~S-02~~ | ~~Database~~ | **Fixed** — Added `@@unique([recommendationId, factorType])` constraint to `EtdFactor`; `createMany` uses `skipDuplicates: true` |
| ~~S-03~~ | ~~API~~ | **Fixed** — `findByGuideline` now fetches all sections and builds full recursive tree in memory |
| ~~S-04~~ | ~~API~~ | **Fixed** — Added `POST /guidelines/:id/restore` and `POST /sections/:id/restore` endpoints |

### P3 — Security / operations gaps
| # | Area | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| ~~O-01~~ | ~~Security~~ | **Fixed** — Installed `@nestjs/throttler` with global `ThrottlerGuard` at 100 req/min |
| ~~O-02~~ | ~~Security~~ | **Fixed** — Added FileValidationPipe with 10MB size limit, MIME whitelist (13 types), magic bytes verification. 37 tests. |
| ~~O-03~~ | ~~Auth~~ | **Fixed** — RbacGuard checks org-level ADMIN membership and guideline-level `GuidelinePermission` role against `@Roles()` requirements |
| ~~O-04~~ | ~~Ops~~ | **Fixed** — Added `GET /health/ready` endpoint with database connectivity check (`$queryRaw SELECT 1`); returns 503 when DB unavailable |
| ~~O-05~~ | ~~Testing~~ | **Fixed** — Added Playwright E2E test suite at `apps/e2e/` (65 tests, 100% pass rate). Covers: navigation, dashboard stats, guidelines CRUD, guideline workspace tabs, section tree, references page, error/empty states. Found and fixed ActivityLogPanel crash (see B-05 below). |

## E2E Test Findings (from Playwright test run 2026-03-09)

The following issues were discovered during the first E2E test run:

### Bugs Found and Fixed
| # | Area | Issue | Resolution |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| B-05 | Frontend / Activity Log | `ActivityLogPanel` used `useMemo` (synchronous render) to call `setAllEntries` state setter — caused infinite re-render loop on mount, crashing the component and producing a blank page when the Activity tab was clicked | **Fixed**: Changed `useMemo` → `useEffect`; stabilised `currentPageEntries` with `useMemo([data?.entries])` to prevent new array reference on every render |

### Issues Identified (not yet fixed)
| # | Priority | Area | Issue | Notes |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------|
| E-01 | P2 | Frontend / Navigation | Sidebar brand name "OpenGRADE" also appears in the Dashboard welcome heading "Welcome to OpenGRADE", causing strict-mode violations in test locators targeting just the sidebar text | **Fixed**: Added `aria-label="Application brand"` to sidebar brand div for unambiguous targeting |
| E-02 | P2 | Frontend / Workspace | Workspace tab bar buttons share CSS classes with the workspace header div, making it ambiguous to select the tab bar specifically via CSS class selectors | **Fixed**: Added `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `aria-selected` for semantic HTML; E2E tests updated to use `getByRole('tablist')` |
| E-03 | P1 | Frontend / ActivityLogPanel | `displayedEntries` useMemo has `allEntries` in its closure but NOT in its dependency array — paginated "load more" will not correctly accumulate entries across pages because stale closure is used | **Fixed**: Replaced stale-closure `useMemo` with a `useEffect` accumulator using functional `setAllEntries(prev => ...)` pattern |
| E-04 | P2 | Frontend / References | The `ReferencesPage` `useReferences` hook expects a paginated response `{data, total, page, limit}`, but the references mock in `setupApiMocks` returned a plain array — the paginated format must be used in production | Fixed in test setup; API must always return the paginated envelope |
| E-05 | P2 | Backend / Auth | API endpoints have no auth guards applied globally (no `@UseGuards` on controllers, `AuthGuard` not registered globally in `AppModule`) — all endpoints are effectively public | **Fixed**: Registered `AuthGuard` as `APP_GUARD` in `AppModule`; added `@Public()` to health endpoints |
| E-06 | P3 | Frontend / Error states | React Query default `retry: 1` with exponential backoff delays error states by ~1 second, which can cause flaky E2E tests if tests don't use sufficient timeouts when simulating API failures | **Fixed**: Set `retry: false` in `QueryClient` default options to surface errors immediately |
| E-07 | P3 | Frontend / Workspace sections | The section tree mock data had sections named "Recommendations" which conflicted with the workspace tab label "Recommendations", causing strict-mode violations in button selectors | Fixed in test data — section renamed to "Clinical Recommendations" |
